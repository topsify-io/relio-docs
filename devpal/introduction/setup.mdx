In order for DevPal to work, the system needs to be able to:

- Collect API metadata from your code repositories.

- Run queries against your APIs to aggregate/ derive a handful of metrics and
  statistics used for API Drift, breaking and other such info.

docker run -p 8080:8080 devpal/all-in-one:latest
```

- Onboarding Repositories(5 minutes) - see onboarding section

- Initial scan of repositories(10m - 2 hours)
