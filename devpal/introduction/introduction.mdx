Your users – be it other teams working with your private APIs or end customers using your public APIs – all depend on one crucial aspect: the API fulfilling its promises. This commitment to ensuring that APIs perform as expected is what we call **API Integrity**.

However, managing this aspect of APIs can be a complex and time-consuming task, requiring constant vigilance against breaking changes, misaligned implementations, and documentation drift. Your company's focus should be on creating exceptional products, not getting caught up in the complexities of API management.

That's where Relio comes in, offering a powerful solution tailored to your needs. Relio's platform streamlines the process from source code to runtime, ensuring the reliability and consistency of your APIs. By concentrating on user expectations and providing the necessary resources, Relio empowers your team to confidently manage APIs, allowing you to focus on delivering outstanding user experiences.
