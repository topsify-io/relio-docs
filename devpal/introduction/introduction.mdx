As the **API Producer**, your users – whether they are other teams collaborating with your private APIs or end customers engaging with your public APIs – all rely on a key aspect, you maintain your side of the contract.

This contract takes various forms depending on the communication protocol: OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) for REST, gRPC for RPC, and AsyncAPI for asynchronous communication.

However, managing this aspect of APIs can be a complex and time-consuming task, requiring constant vigilance against breaking changes, misaligned implementations, and documentation drift.

Relio's platform streamlines the process from source code to runtime, ensuring the integrity and consistency of your APIs. Empowering your team to confidently manage their APIs, and focusing on delivering outstanding API experiences.

## What does Relio do?

- **Performs Comprehensive API Discovery** - by analyzing your repositories and performing code analysis. Builds a graph of all your API implementations within your organization, and maps internal APIs to public APIs.

- **Detects, remediates, and prevents API implementation issues** - assessing their impact and notifying the relevant stakeholders. Ensures proactive management of breaking changes and drift.

## What can Relio do for my private APIs?

Your private APIs shouldn't take a backseat. Relio automatically **discovers** all your service-to-service communication, including REST, event-based, and RPC. Through Active Governance, Relio guarantees that all services consistently perform as expected, avoiding disruptions for any downstream consumers. Experience the confidence of never pushing a breaking change again.
