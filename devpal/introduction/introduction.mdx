API Consumers – whether they are services accessing APIs **privately** or end customers interacting with your **public** APIs – depend on APIs being well-documented, in sync with their implementations, and more.

However, managing these aspects of APIs can be a complex and time-consuming task, requiring continuous attention to avoid breaking changes, misaligned implementations, and documentation drift.

Relio's platform streamlines the process from source code to runtime, ensuring the integrity and consistency of your APIs. This empowers your teams to confidently manage their APIs while focusing on delivering outstanding API experiences.

## What does Relio do?

- **Performs Comprehensive API Discovery** - by analyzing your repositories and performing code analysis. Relio builds a graph of all your API implementations within your organization, and maps internal APIs to public APIs.

- **Detects, remediates, and prevents API implementation issues** - by assessing their impact and notifying the relevant stakeholders. Relio ensures proactive management of breaking changes and drift.

## What can Relio do for my private APIs?
