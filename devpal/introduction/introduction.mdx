API Consumers – whether it's services accessing APIs **privately** or end customers interacting with your **public** APIs – all rely on APIs being well-documented, in sync with their implementations, and more.

Nonetheless, managing these aspects of APIs can be a complex and time-consuming endeavor, necessitating continuous attention to avoid breaking changes, misaligned implementations, and documentation drift.

Relio's platform streamlines the process from source code to runtime, ensuring the integrity and consistency of your APIs. Empowering your teams to confidently manage their APIs, and focusing on delivering outstanding API experiences.

## What does Relio do?

- **Performs Comprehensive API Discovery** - by analyzing your repositories and performing code analysis. Builds a graph of all your API implementations within your organization, and maps internal APIs to public APIs.
