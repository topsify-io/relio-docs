API consumers, whether they are clients using your public APIs or internal services interacting with private APIs, rely on well-documented, up-to-date implementations and 'breaking free' changes.

However, addressing these aspects of APIs can be a daunting and time-consuming task, necessitating collaboration with siloed development teams. Relio's platform simplifies this process from source code to runtime, ensuring the integrity and consistency of your APIs. 


## What does Relio do?

- **Performs Comprehensive API Discovery** - by analyzing your repositories and performing code analysis. Relio builds a graph of all your API implementations within your organization, and maps internal APIs to public and private APIs.

- **Detects, remediates, and prevents API implementation issues** - by assessing their impact and notifying the relevant stakeholders. Relio ensures proactive management of breaking changes and drift.

## What can Relio do for my private APIs?

Relio provides automatic **discovery** of all your service-to-service communication, including REST, event-based, and RPC. Relio guarantees API integrity, avoiding disruptions for any downstream consumers.

## What can Relio do for my public APIs?

Relio provides streamlined management of your public APIs, ensuring your OpenAPI specifications are well-documented and in sync with their implementation.

## What can Relio do for partner APIs?

Relio provides simplified partner API management by enabling you to create tailored API access and documentation for each partner. Easily customize OpenAPI specs for individual partners to provide relevant API documentation, enhancing custom tailored experience and fostering successful partnerships.
