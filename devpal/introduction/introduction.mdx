title: "What is Relio?"
description:
  "Relio is the first end-to-end solution for guaranteeing API reliability in
  todays fast moving development environment."
---

DevPal solution is rooted in shift left, giving engineers, API teams, managers
the ability to build reliability APIs early and quickly.

Relio uses static code analysis to detect, prevent and remediate API
implementation issues, assess its impact, and notify those who need to know.

Delivering:

- **End to End Visibility** from code implementations to OpenAPI specifications
  deployed across all your your runtime environments

- **Automated Internal API Catalog -** Real-time analysis and centralized API
  cataloguing providing a single pane-of-glass view that allows teams to better
  understand the accessibility, location, health, and ownership of all their
  APIs.

- **Maintaining Production Level APIs**\- Maintaining up to date APIs
  documentation, preventing breaking API changes before reaching main branches.

- **Simplified Tool Chain -** Trigger workflow such as updating, Gateways,
  Service meshes -> Release Notes → SDKS → Updating Postman Collections
