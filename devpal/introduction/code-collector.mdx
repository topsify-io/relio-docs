Our code collection tool, Micromap, uses static code analysis to scan for both
API definition files, such as OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, GRPC, and GraphQL as well as
routes defined within the codebase. Micromap supports scanning both annotations,
which are commonly used to define endpoints above their respective handlers for
frameworks such as SpringBoot, as well as dynamically defined endpoints such as
those found in Express.js.

Micromap's current web framework support, as well as roadmap, is as follows:

| Frameworks | Language   | Release Date   |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| SpringBoot | Java       | 1 March (Beta) |
| Express.js | JavaScript | 1 March (Beta) |
| FastAPI    | Python     | 1 May (Alpha)  |
