DevPal provides real time discovery of all your APIs - Surfacing all APIs, without requiring any manual input nor direct participation from developers. 

Let's find out what makes DevPal makes search intuitive and super quick.

### What is lineage?

API lineage captures how APIs are mapped across your specification and internal APIs. This information is useful to:

* Trace APIs routes and specification files, to assist with root cause analysis

* Trace API code implementations, to assist with impact analysis.

* Automate the evaluation of workflows such as merging of smaller internal specifications into larger merged specification files.
