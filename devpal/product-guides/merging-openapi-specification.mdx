  "This guide will demonstrate how to merge multiple specifications into a
  single unified OpenAPI Specification."

Breaking down large OpenAPI specifications into smaller more modular specs is
always a good idea. However distributing multiple specifications to your clients
can have its own usability challenges.

Benefits of Merged OpenAPI Specification:

1. Single Specification is easier to version
2. Provides single specification to customers
3. Easier to distribute SDKs

Challenges of Unified Schema:

1. Hard to coordinate changes, merge conflicts
2. Bottleneck and PR processes, means changes are lagging
3. APIs must be merged into global namespace

Currently, this is supported from the RestAPI.
