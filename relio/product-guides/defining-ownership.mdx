Clear ownership is important for cutting down the time it takes to resolve
particular issues. Users can easily triage or quickly reach out to the owner of
the API for any questions about the the API.

<Info>
  The Relio collectors **automatically** reports fine grained API ownership of
  both implementations and specifications that it locates across analyzed git
  repositories.

The owner is responsible for maintaining the particular lifecycle of the
API(implementation or specification).
